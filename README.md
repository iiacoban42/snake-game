# Snake Game

A remake of the classic snake game.

## Prerequisites

Java 13 and Gradle 6

## Getting Started

Import the project into your IDE with gradle by selecting the template or the server directory. In order to use the login and to connect to the database, the server has to be imported first. Afterwards, the template needs to be imported in a new tab and launched while the server is running. If the gradle build fails, then using a local distribution of gradle 6 might fix the issue.

## Launching the game

- Run a postgreSQL server with user:password (postgres:qwerty) . This can be modified in application.properties.
- Launch the server in IntelliJ
- Run DesktopLauncher in template in a new IntelliJ tab  
- Play  

## Built With

Spring - The client-server communication  
Libgdx - Graphics  
Junit, mockito - Tests  
Gradle - Dependency Management  
Hibernate - Database  
PostgreSQL - Database
